       "  '<p id=\"p-0003\" num=\"0002\">A modern organization typically maintains a data storage system to store and deliver sensitive information concerning various significant business aspects of the organization. Sensitive information may include data on customers (or patients), contracts, deliveries, supplies, employees, manufacturing, or the like. In addition, sensitive information may include intellectual property (IP) of an organization such as software code developed by employees of the organization, documents describing inventions conceived by employees of the organization, etc. In today\\'s global marketplace environment, employees often change their place of employment and may end up moving to a competitor of their former employer. If a new employee possesses knowledge of IP of his or her former employer, this may become a matter of concern for both the former employer and the present employer. For example, if the two competitors are software companies, the former employer has the risk of losing software code developed by a former employee, and the current employer has the risk of being unknowingly liable for IP infringement if the new employee uses the software code developed at the former employer.</p>',\n",

       "  '<p id=\"p-0013\" num=\"0012\">A system and method for improving data loss prevention (DLP) via cross leveraging fingerprints of protected data is described. In one embodiment, a DLP service provider distributes fingerprints of sensitive data of multiple organizations across DLP systems of these organizations. Sensitive data may include personal information pertaining to employees of an organization, personal information pertaining to customers of the organization, information pertaining to business process of the organization, information pertaining to intellectual property (IP) of the organization, etc. A DLP system of each organization monitors information content associated with this organization to detect sensitive data of other organizations (&#x201c;external sensitive data&#x201d;), and notifies a user (e.g., a system administrator) about the detection of the external sensitive data. In addition, the DLP system of each organization sends information regarding the detection of external sensitive data to the DLP service provider. Based on this information, the DLP service provider informs each organization about the detection of their sensitive data at the sites of other organizations.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p id=\"p-0014\" num=\"0013\">As a result, the DLP service provider allows to detect leakage of sensitive data of an organization by virtue of finding this sensitive data at some other organization\\'s site. In addition, the DLP service provider informs the other organization of the presence of external sensitive data at its site, thus making the other organization aware of potential liability associated with such a presence (e.g., potential liability for IP infringement if a new employee uses software code developed at his or her former employer).</p>',\n",
       "  '<p id=\"p-0015\" num=\"0014\">In the following description, numerous details are set forth. It will be apparent, however, to one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form, rather than in detail, in order to avoid obscuring the present invention.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p id=\"p-0016\" num=\"0015\">Some portions of the detailed description that follow are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p id=\"p-0017\" num=\"0016\">It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the description, discussions utilizing terms such as &#x201c;processing&#x201d;, &#x201c;computing&#x201d;, &#x201c;calculating&#x201d;, &#x201c;determining&#x201d;, &#x201c;displaying&#x201d; or the like, refer to the actions and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (e.g., electronic) quantities within the computer system\\'s registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.</p>',\n",
       "  '<p id=\"p-0018\" num=\"0017\">The present invention also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs, and magnetic-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions.</p>',\n",

System architecture <b>100</b> may include networks <b>104</b> of various organizations (e.g., enterprises, small businesses, etc.). Each organization has computers and storage devices coupled to each other via a network (e.g., local area network (LAN)). The computers and the storage devices may store sensitive data of the organization in the form of databases, files, libraries, web pages, etc. The sensitive data may include, for example, confidential employee information, confidential client or patient information, business process information, IP information (e.g., software code, invention disclosure information, etc.), etc.</p>',\n",

Sensitive information may include data on customers (or patients), contracts, deliveries, supplies, employees, manufacturing, or the like. In addition, sensitive information may include intellectual property (IP) of an organization such as software code developed by employees of the organization, documents describing inventions conceived by employees of the organization, etc. In today\\'s global marketplace environment, employees often change their place of employment and may end up moving to a competitor of their former employer. If a new employee possesses knowledge of IP of his or her former employer, this may become a matter of concern for both the former employer and the present employer. For example, if the two competitors are software companies, the former employer has the risk of losing software code developed by a former employee, and the current employer has the risk of being unknowingly liable for IP infringement if the new employee uses the software code developed at the former employer.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\">Existing security techniques fail to provide efficient solutions that can protect organizations in the situations described above.</p>\\n<heading id=\"h-0003\" level=\"1\">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>\\n<p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">A method and system for improving data loss prevention via cross leveraging fingerprints of protected data is described.

In one embodiment, a DLP service provider distributes fingerprints of sensitive data of multiple organizations across DLP systems of these organizations. Sensitive data may include personal information pertaining to employees of an organization, personal information pertaining to customers of the organization, information pertaining to business process of the organization, information pertaining to intellectual property (IP) of the organization, etc. A DLP system of each organization monitors information content associated with this organization to detect sensitive data of other organizations (&#x201c;external sensitive data&#x201d;), and notifies a user (e.g., a system administrator) about the detection of the external sensitive data. In addition, the DLP system of each organization sends information regarding the detection of external sensitive data to the DLP service provider. Based on this information, the DLP service provider informs each organization about the detection of their sensitive data at the sites of other organizations.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0014\" num=\"0013\">As a result, the DLP service provider allows to detect leakage of sensitive data of an organization by virtue of finding this sensitive data at some other organization\\'s site. In addition, the DLP service provider informs the other organization of the presence of external sensitive data at its site, thus making the other organization aware of potential liability associated with such a presence (e.g., potential liability for IP infringement if a new employee uses software code developed at his or her former employer).</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0015\" num=\"0014\">In the following description, numerous details are set forth. It will be apparent, however, to one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form, rather than in detail, in order to avoid obscuring the present invention.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0016\" num=\"0015\">Some portions of the detailed description that follow are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0017\" num=\"0016\">It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the description, discussions utilizing terms such as &#x201c;processing&#x201d;, &#x201c;computing&#x201d;, &#x201c;calculating&#x201d;, &#x201c;determining&#x201d;, &#x201c;displaying&#x201d; or the like, refer to the actions and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (e.g., electronic) quantities within the computer system\\'s registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0018\" num=\"0017\">The present invention also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs, and magnetic-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0019\" num=\"0018\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of exemplary system architecture <b>100</b> in which embodiments of the present invention may operate. System architecture <b>100</b> may include networks <b>104</b> of various organizations (e.g., enterprises, small businesses, etc.). Each organization has computers and storage devices coupled to each other via a network (e.g., local area network (LAN)). The computers and the storage devices may store sensitive data of the organization in the form of databases, files, libraries, web pages, etc. The sensitive data may include, for example, confidential employee information, confidential client or patient information, business process information, IP information (e.g., software code, invention disclosure information, etc.), etc.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0020\" num=\"0019\">Each network <b>104</b> has a DLP system <b>106</b> that may be part of network <b>104</b> or be coupled to the network <b>104</b>. The DLP system <b>106</b> may be hosted by one or more machines including one or more server computers, client computers, gateways or any other computing devices. The DLP systems <b>106</b> are coupled to a DLP service provider <b>102</b> via a network (e.g., a public network such as Internet or a private network such as LAN). The DLP service provider <b>102</b> may include one or more servers or other computing devices communicating with the DLP systems <b>106</b> as will be discussed in more detail below.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0021\" num=\"0020\">The DLP system <b>106</b> scans information within the organization network <b>104</b> and electronic communications transferred from, and to, the organization network <b>104</b> to detect sensitive data that violates DLP policies. A DLP policy may specify conditions that trigger a violation based on regulations concerning handling of sensitive data maintained by an organization, or based on corporate data governance rules. These regulations may include, for example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) ensuring the confidentiality of electronic protected health information, California Senate Bill 1 (SB1) or Senate Bill 1386 (SB1386) controlling customer information leaving the company and affiliates, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act controlling customer information leaving a financial institution, the Cardholder Information Security Program (CISP) controlling handling of customer credit card information maintained by an organization, or the like.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0022\" num=\"0021\">The DLP system <b>106</b> performs the scanning using fingerprints of source data. A fingerprint includes an encrypted or hashed copy of the source data or some other representation of the source data that would not allow a malicious user to recover the actual content of the source data. The DLP system <b>106</b> may create fingerprints from sensitive data stored within the organization (&#x201c;internal sensitive data&#x201d;) and store it in a data store <b>108</b> (e.g., a database, a repository, etc.).</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0023\" num=\"0022\">When scanning information content stored within the network <b>104</b> and/or information content sent and/or received by the network <b>104</b>, the DLP system <b>106</b> may determine that the information content includes sensitive data that violates a DLP policy. The DLP system <b>106</b> may then report the policy violation to a designated user (e.g., a system administrator, a supervisor of the sender or recipient, etc.), prevent the transfer of the information content violating the DLP policy, or perform some other action.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0024\" num=\"0023\">In one embodiment, the DLP service provider <b>102</b> allows the organizations to share fingerprints of their sensitive data. In particular, the DLP service provider <b>102</b> may distribute fingerprints of an organization to DLP systems of other organizations participating in the fingerprint sharing. The DLP system <b>106</b> of each other organization will then store these external fingerprints in a data store <b>110</b>.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0025\" num=\"0024\">During monitoring, the DLP system <b>106</b> will scan information content using both the internal fingerprints <b>108</b> and the external fingerprints <b>110</b>. Upon detecting the presence of external sensitive data in the information content being scanned, the DLP system <b>106</b> will notify a designated user (e.g., a system administrator) of this incident. In addition, the DLP system <b>106</b> will send information on the detection of external sensitive data to the DLP service provider <b>102</b>.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0026\" num=\"0025\">The DLP service provider <b>102</b> will receive information on the detection of external sensitive data from various DLP systems <b>106</b> and will use this information to compile a report for each participating organization regarding this organization\\'s sensitive data detected at the sites of other organizations. The DLP service provider <b>102</b> will then send the resulting reports to designated users within corresponding organizations.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0027\" num=\"0026\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of one embodiment of a DLP service provider <b>200</b>. The DLP service provider <b>200</b> may include a fingerprint distributor <b>202</b>, a report generator <b>204</b>, and a customer database <b>206</b>.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0028\" num=\"0027\">The customer database <b>206</b> may include a list of organizations that have requested the fingerprint sharing feature of the DLP service. The fingerprint sharing feature allows an organization to publish fingerprints of its sensitive data at other organizations\\' sites, and to receive reports specifying the detection of its sensitive data at the other organizations\\' sites. In addition, the fingerprint sharing feature may allow an organization to host other organizations\\' fingerprints at its site, and to receive reports specifying the detection of the other organizations\\' sensitive data at its own site. In one embodiment, the DLP service provider <b>200</b> enables the fingerprint sharing feature only if the number of organizations that have requested this feature exceeds a predefined threshold.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0029\" num=\"0028\">For each organization requesting the fingerprint sharing feature, the customer database <b>206</b> may store the name <b>210</b> of the organization and a unique customer ID <b>208</b> assigned to the organization. In addition, the customer database <b>206</b> may specify whether the organization has agreed to sharing fingerprints (column <b>212</b>) and to allowing the detection of external sensitive data (column <b>214</b>). It should be noted that the format of the customer database <b>206</b> is shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref> for illustration only and is not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure in any way.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0030\" num=\"0029\">The fingerprint distributor <b>202</b> is responsible for receiving a request from an organization (e.g., via a respective DLP system <b>106</b>) to use the fingerprint sharing feature, automatically assigning a unique customer number to this organization, and storing this information in the customer database <b>206</b>. In addition, the fingerprint distributor <b>202</b> may determine whether the request covers publishing of fingerprints at the DLP systems of other organizations. If so, the fingerprint distributor <b>202</b> obtains the fingerprints of the requesting organization, adds the customer number of the organization to the fingerprints, and distributes the fingerprints to the DLP systems of the other organizations. In one embodiment, the fingerprint distributor <b>202</b> also distributes DLP policies, defining detection of external sensitive data, to the DLP systems of the other organizations. Alternatively, the DLP policies are created by each DLP systems receiving the fingerprints of the external sensitive data.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0031\" num=\"0030\">Further, the fingerprint distributor <b>202</b> may determine whether the request covers the detection of external sensitive data at the site of the requesting organization. If so, the fingerprint distributor <b>202</b> sends the fingerprints of the other organizations to the DLP system of the requestor.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0032\" num=\"0031\">The report generator <b>204</b> is responsible for receiving, from DLP systems of various organizations, information on detection of external sensitive data at the sites of these organizations. Each detection incident specifies a customer ID of an organization whose sensitive data has been detected at the site of another organization. Based on the customer ID, the report generator <b>204</b> creates a report for each organization and sends it to the relevant organization.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0033\" num=\"0032\">The use of customer IDs allows the DLP service provider <b>200</b> to link detection incidents to organizations whose sensitive data is being leaked, without revealing the identity of the organization, thus providing additional protection against group force attacks directed to the fingerprints of the organization.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0034\" num=\"0033\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of one embodiment of a DLP system <b>300</b>. The DLP system <b>300</b> may include a fingerprint manager <b>301</b>, a policy manager <b>302</b>, a policy violation detector <b>304</b>, a violation reporter <b>306</b>, a policy data store <b>308</b>, an internal fingerprint data store <b>310</b>, and an external fingerprint <b>312</b>.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0035\" num=\"0034\">The fingerprint manager <b>301</b> creates fingerprints of sensitive data within an organization that should be protected (&#x201c;source data&#x201d;) and stores them in the internal fingerprint data store <b>310</b>. In addition, the fingerprint manager <b>301</b> receives fingerprints of external sensitive data and stores them in the external fingerprint data store <b>312</b>. In one embodiment, the external fingerprints are stored in association with a corresponding customer ID.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0036\" num=\"0035\">The policy manager <b>302</b> defines DLP policies and stores them in the policy store <b>308</b>. A policy may specify source data that should be protected from unauthorized transmission, access or any other use, and may also specify which portions of the source data should be included in information content to trigger a policy violation.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0037\" num=\"0036\">The policy manager <b>302</b> may create DLP policies based on user input. Alternatively, the policy manager <b>302</b> may receive DLP policies (e.g., DLP policies with respect to external sensitive data) from the DLP service provider <b>102</b> and store them in the policy store <b>308</b>.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0038\" num=\"0037\">The policy violation detector <b>304</b> scans information content (e.g., content stored in databases, caches, etc, and content of transmitted messages) using internal fingerprints and external fingerprints. Upon detecting a match, the policy violation detector <b>304</b> determines whether this match violates a DLP policy. If so, the policy violation detector <b>304</b> invokes the violation reporter <b>306</b> that performs a predetermined action such as reporting the violation, blocking the transfer of the information content, etc.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0039\" num=\"0038\">If the policy being violated concerns external sensitive data, the violation reporter <b>306</b> notifies a system administrator or some other user about the policy violation incident, and sends information on the policy violation incident to the DLP service provider <b>102</b>. The information sent to the DLP service provider may identify, for example, the DLP policy being violated, the customer ID associated with the detected sensitive data, the detected sensitive data, one or more parties that caused the violation, etc.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0040\" num=\"0039\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow diagram of one embodiment of a method for improving DLP via cross leveraging fingerprints. The method <b>400</b> is performed by processing logic that may comprise hardware (circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), software (such as is run on a general purpose computer system or a dedicated machine), or a combination of both.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0041\" num=\"0040\">In one embodiment, the method <b>400</b> is performed by the DLP service provider <b>102</b> or <b>200</b>.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0042\" num=\"0041\">Referring to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>, processing logic begins with receiving request from a DLP system of customer A to publish fingerprints of its sensitive data (also referred as protected data) at the sites of other customers (block <b>402</b>). In response, in one embodiment, processing logic obtains the fingerprints from the DLP system of customer A, and associates the fingerprints with the ID of customer A (block <b>404</b>). In another embodiment, processing logic sends the ID of customer A to the DLP system of customer A and instructs the DLP system of customer A to associate the fingerprints of customer A with this ID.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0043\" num=\"0042\">At block <b>406</b>, processing logic determines which other customers are interested in fingerprint sharing. Next, in one embodiment, processing logic sends the fingerprints of customer A to DLP systems of the other customers (block <b>408</b>), and sends the fingerprints of the other customers to the DLP system of customer A. In another embodiment, processing logic instructs the DLP system of customer A to send the fingerprints of customer A to the DLP systems of the other customers, and instructs the DLP systems of the other customers to send their fingerprints to the DLP system of customer A.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0044\" num=\"0043\">In addition, in one embodiment, processing logic also distributes DLP policies pertaining to fingerprints of customer A to the DLP systems of the other customers, and/or DLP policies pertaining to fingerprints of the other customers to the DLP system of customer A. Alternatively, the DLP policies are not shared but are rather defined by the DLP systems receiving the fingerprints of external sensitive data.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0045\" num=\"0044\">At block <b>410</b>, processing logic receives information on the detection of external sensitive data from DLP systems of various customers. The received information may identify the DLP policy being violated, the customer ID associated with the detected sensitive data, the detected sensitive data, one or more parties that caused the violation, etc.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0046\" num=\"0045\">At block <b>412</b>, processing logic compiles a report, for each customer ID, based on this customer\\'s sensitive data detected at the other customers\\' sites. At block <b>414</b>, processing logic determines the identity of the customer based on the customer ID, determines which users should receive the report, and sends the report to these users.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0047\" num=\"0046\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref> is a flow diagram of one embodiment of a method for detecting sensitive data in information content of an organization. The method <b>500</b> is performed by processing logic that may comprise hardware (circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), software (such as is run on a general purpose computer system or a dedicated machine), or a combination of both. In one embodiment, the method <b>500</b> is performed by the DLP system <b>106</b> or <b>300</b>.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0048\" num=\"0047\">Referring to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>, processing logic begins with receiving fingerprints of external data to be protected (block <b>502</b>). At block <b>504</b>, processing logic defines DLP policies concerning the external data. In one embodiment, these DLP policies are created based on user input. Alternatively, these DLP policies are received from the DLP service provider or from the DLP systems of other organizations.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0049\" num=\"0048\">At block <b>506</b>, processing logic monitors information content to detect DLP policy violations. If no violation is detected, method <b>500</b> ends. If a policy violation is detected, processing logic determines whether the violation concerns external sensitive data (block <b>510</b>). If not, processing logic performs a predefined action for handling detection of internal sensitive data (e.g., preventing transfer of the information content, notifying a supervisor of a user who caused the detected violation, etc.). If so, processing logic informs the system administrator or some other designated user of this policy violation incident that was caused by external sensitive data (block <b>512</b>).

The queues have been utilized by the data processing systems to store data that is waiting to be processed. However, techniques generally utilized for processing data stored in such queues have exhibited various limitations.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\">One technique conventionally utilized for processing data in the queue has been to utilize a lock on the queue. As an example, a locking queue utilizes a lock to indicate that data is being read and written to the queue. As a result of the locking queue, a speed of processing is reduced by preventing other processing from being performed while the queue is locked.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">Another technique conventionally utilized for processing data in the queue has been to utilize a lock free queue. For example, the lock free queue allows for data to be read and written to the queue without utilizing a lock. However, traditionally lock free queues have only allowed for a single dimension queue.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">There is thus a need for addressing these and/or other issues associated with the prior art.</p>\\n<heading id=\"h-0003\" level=\"1\">SUMMARY</heading>\\n<p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">A data structure, method, and computer program provide a linked list in a first dimension and a plurality of linked lists in a second dimension.

See operation <b>404</b>. As an option, the tail pointer may be associated with the second linked list by pointing to a last node in the second linked list. The tail pointer may not necessarily be included in the data structure, in one embodiment.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0043\" num=\"0042\">Further, as yet another option, the tail pointer may include a null value if the tail pointer does not point to a node in the second linked list. For example, if there are not any nodes associated with the second linked list, then the tail pointer may include the null value. It should be noted that the tail pointer may be identified in any desired manner that is based on the event (e.g. based on a characteristic of the event, etc.).</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0044\" num=\"0043\">Additionally, as shown in operation <b>406</b>, the event is inserted into the data structure as a node, based on the tail pointer. Furthermore, as shown in operation <b>406</b>, if the tail pointer is null, the node is inserted into the first linked list, and if the tail pointer is not null, the node is inserted as a new tail node for the one of the second linked lists.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0045\" num=\"0044\">Still yet, as shown in operation <b>406</b>, upon insertion of the event into the second linked list, the tail pointer associated with the second linked list is updated.

Of course, however, the method <b>500</b> may be carried out in any desired environment. Again, the aforementioned definitions may equally apply to the description below.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0047\" num=\"0046\">As shown in operation <b>502</b>, an event is identified. As an example, the event may be identified based on being received, waiting to be added to a data structure (e.g. the data structure <b>300</b> of <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>), etc. Further, as shown in operation <b>504</b>, an event counter is assigned to the event. Optionally, the event counter may include a unique identifier.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0048\" num=\"0047\">Optionally, the event counter may be based on a sequence of identifying events. As an example, a first event may be assigned a first identifier in the sequence, and a second event may be assigned a second identifier in the sequence. Further, as yet another option, the event counter may be stored in the event, stored in a head pointer of the event, stored in a tail pointer of the event, associated with the event, etc.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0049\" num=\"0048\">In addition, a tail counter and a tail pointer associated with a last node in a first linked list are recorded to the event.

For example, the tail counter and the tail pointer may be utilized to narrow a search on the first linked list.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0050\" num=\"0049\">Additionally, as shown in operation <b>508</b>, a second linked list tail pointer is identified based on the event. As an option, a characteristic of the event may be utilized to identify the second linked list tail pointer from a plurality of second linked list tail pointers. Optionally, the characteristic of the event may include a characteristic associated with the second linked list tail pointer.

Further, as still yet another option, the number of tail pointers in the plurality of second linked list tail pointers may be predetermined, dynamically determined, statically determined, etc.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0051\" num=\"0050\">As shown in decision <b>510</b>, it is determined if the second linked list tail pointer includes a null value. Thus, as an option, the second linked list tail pointer may include a pointer to a node or a null value. For example, if there is at least one node in the second linked list associated with the second linked list tail pointer, then the second linked list tail pointer may point to a last node in the second linked list, and may therefore not be null.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0052\" num=\"0051\">If second linked list tail pointer is not null, then the event is inserted as a node into the second linked list as a new tail.

Optionally, if the head pointer of the current tail node of the first linked list does not include the null value, then a new tail node may have been added to the first linked list before the event was inserted as the node in the first linked list. Additionally, as an option, if the new tail node was added, then the head pointer from the current tail node may be followed to the new tail node. Furthermore, as another option, a head pointer of the new tail node may be verified and followed until reaching a tail node including a head pointer that includes a null value.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0055\" num=\"0054\">Further, as yet another option, the head pointer of the verified tail node in the first linked list may be updated to point to the inserted node. As still yet another option, the tail pointer associated with the first linked list may be updated to point to the inserted node. For example, after inserting the node into the first linked list, the tail pointer associated with the first linked list may be updated to point to the inserted node.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0056\" num=\"0055\">Furthermore, as shown in operation <b>516</b>, the second linked list tail pointer is updated to point to the inserted node.

Further, as an option, the node may be inserted into a third linked list of the data structure based on the priority. As another option, if the node is a first node in the third linked list, then a pointer of a node in the second linked list may point to the node inserted into the third linked list. As yet another option, if the node is not the first node in the third linked list, then a last node in the third linked list may point to the node inserted into the third linked list.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0059\" num=\"0058\">For example, if the event is a first event associated with a high priority, it may be inserted as a new node into the third linked list pointed to by a pointer of a node in the second linked list. As another example, if the event is a subsequent event associated with a high priority, it may be inserted as a new tail node into the third linked list. In the context of the current example, a previous tail node in the third linked list may be updated to point to the new tail node in the third linked list.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-0060\" num=\"0059\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref> shows a method <b>600</b> for removing a node from a data structure, in accordance with one embodiment.
