      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\">The present invention relates to the field of immunology. More particularly, the present invention relates to improved methods for inducing immune responses due to infection by pathogenic agents by combining passive and active immunization, and to antibodies that enhance a subject's endogenous immunological response to a pathogen or to cancer cells.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">2. Description of Related Art</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">Immunity encompasses the ability of the human body to both tolerate the presence of endogenous (&#x201c;self&#x201d;) material, and to eliminate foreign (&#x201c;non-self&#x201d;) material, such as infectious agents including viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, etc., and can be achieved via two basic mechanisms: active immunity and passive immunity.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">Active immunity is protection provided by one's own immune system, and involves stimulation of the immune system to produce antigen-specific humoral (antibody) and cellular immunity. Unlike temporary passive immunity, active immunity is more permanent, lasting for many years, or for a lifetime. The persistence of such long-lasting protection is known as &#x201c;immunological memory.&#x201d; Following exposure of the immune system to an antigen, memory B-cells continue to circulate in the blood and reside in the bone marrow for many years. Upon reexposure to the antigen, memory B-cells begin to replicate and rapidly produce antibody, reestablishing protection. Active immunity can be acquired in either of two ways: either by having the natural disease, or by vaccination. Vaccines generate an immune response and prevent the infection with the corresponding infectious pathogen.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\">Passive immunity is provided by introducing products into the body, such as antibodies, produced by an animal or a human. This is usually achieved by injection. Passive immunity provides effective short-lived protection that disappears within a few weeks or months due to catabolism of the immunity-conferring product.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\">The immune system identifies foreign (&#x201c;non-self&#x201d;) substances, referred to as antigens. Antigens can be either live organisms, inactivated/attenuated organisms, or immune system-stimulating peptides, proteins, cell wall polysaccharides, etc., derived from host pathogens. The most effective antigens are generally live organisms. In response to an antigen, the immune system develops defensive antibodies (or immunoglobulins) and specific T cells (cell-mediated immunity) that facilitate elimination of foreign substances, referred to as the &#x201c;immune response.&#x201d;</p>\r",

      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0021\" num=\"0023\">The invention is derived in part from the discovery of potent antibodies which neutralize most, if not all, genetic variants of viruses (Corti D., et al., 2011, A neutralizing antibody selected from plasma cells that binds to group 1 and group 2 influenza A hemagglutinins. <i>Science</i>, 333:850-856) and the discovery of a method of generating a passive and an active immune response in a subject comprising administering a neutralizing antibody and a pathogen to the subject. The invention is further based on the discovery that the use of neutralizing antibodies does not block the generation of immunological memory and long-lasting protection and could, through a series of mechanisms, alter and improve the quality of the immune response to the given pathogen.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0022\" num=\"0024\">The methods of the invention provide a combination of passive and active immunization. The neutralizing antibody prevents or decreases pathogen-induced symptoms without compromising the generation of immunological memory and long-term protection. Further, there may be additional benefits such as a stronger and qualitatively improved, and possibly different, immune response.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0023\" num=\"0025\">Without being bound to any theory, it is believed that the antibody increases presentation of the antigen to B cells and T cells. It is also believed that the antibody skews T helper cell response, i.e., Th1 vs Th2 T cell responses, which could be particularly advantageous for T cell vaccines such as vaccines against tuberculosis or RSV.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0024\" num=\"0026\">By administering a neutralizing antibody and a pathogen, neutralized by the antibody, to a subject, the subject can get immediate protection from the disease or infection caused by the pathogen via the injection of the antibody, and broad, active immunity (both B-cell and T-cell based immunity) in response to the pathogen. This may enable the development of a simple vaccine process, and, importantly, allows development of vaccines for infections or disorders for which vaccines were, until now, difficult to develop. Such infections or disorders are those for which it is difficult to obtain the key epitopes in a form that provokes a broad immunological response required of a vaccine. Examples of such diseases or disorders include, but are not limited to, those caused by pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2), hepatitis C (HCV) etc. With the methods of the present invention, it is now possible to elicit a broad immunological response by the administration of such pathogens as well as very potent antibodies that neutralize the infectivity of the pathogens.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0025\" num=\"0027\">In one aspect of the invention, the invention comprises methods for generating, stimulating or eliciting a passive and an active vaccine or immune response in a subject, or ameliorating or eliminating the severity of an infection in a subject, or limiting infection of a subject by a pathogen.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0026\" num=\"0028\">In one embodiment of the invention, the invention comprises a method of generating an active vaccine or immune response in a subject comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of an antibody and an antigen.

In one embodiment, 1, 2, 3, or more doses of the antibody are administered. In another embodiment, 1, 2, 3, or more doses of the antigen are administered. The doses of antibody and antigen may be administered concurrently or sequentially, as discussed above. Further, if the doses of antibody and antigen are administered sequentially, they may be administered in any order, and with the time intervals as discussed above.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0055\" num=\"0057\">The route of administration of the antibody and antigen is also important as different routes confer different rates and levels of bioavailability as well as result in the elicitation of different response mechanisms. In the methods, kits and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention the antibody and antigen may be administered by either the same, or by different routes. In one embodiment, the antibody and the antigen are administered by the same route. In another embodiment, the antibody and the antigen are administered by different routes. Examples of such routes include, but are not limited to, oral, dermal, intranasal, intramuscular, intravenous, intrathecal, intravaginal, intravitreal, rectal administration, subcutaneous, intra-arterial, intramedullary, intraperitoneal, intraventricular, transdermal, transcutaneous, topical, enteral or sublingual.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0056\" num=\"0058\">The antibody used in the methods, kits and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be monoclonal or polyclonal; they may be human antibodies or humanized antibodies. In addition, they may be antibody fragments that have retained their ability to bind the antigen as well as their protective/neutralizing ability. In one embodiment, the antibodies are very potent and only a low concentration of the antibodies is needed for neutralizing the pathogen. In another embodiment, the antibodies are very broadly neutralizing and have the ability to neutralize several strains, clades, sub-groups or groups of a pathogen.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0057\" num=\"0059\">The antibody may be isolated, and may be provided in purified form. Typically, the antibody will be present in a composition that is substantially free of other polypeptides e.g., where less than 90% (by weight), usually less than 60% and more usually less than 50% of the composition is made up of other polypeptides.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0058\" num=\"0060\">The antibody can be of any isotype (e.g., IgA, IgG, IgM i.e. an a, &#x3b3; or &#x3bc; heavy chain). Within the IgG isotype, the antibodies may be IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 subclass. The antibodies may have a &#x3ba; or a &#x3bb; light chain.</p>\r",

      "<p id=\"p-0059\" num=\"0061\">Production of Antibodies</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0060\" num=\"0062\">Antibodies for use in the invention can be made by any method known in the art. For example, the general methodology for making monoclonal antibodies using hybridoma technology is well known (Kohler, G. and Milstein, C., 1975; Kozbar et al. 1983). In one embodiment, the alternative, improved EBV immortalization method described in WO2004/076677 is used.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0061\" num=\"0063\">Using the method described in WO 2004/076677, B cells producing the antibody of the invention can be transformed with EBV and a polyclonal B cell activator. Additional stimulants of cellular growth and differentiation may optionally be added during the transformation step to further enhance the efficiency. These stimulants may be cytokines such as IL-2 and IL-15. In one aspect, IL-2 is added during the immortalization step to further improve the efficiency of immortalization, but its use is not essential. The immortalized B cells produced using these methods can then be cultured using methods known in the art and antibodies isolated therefrom.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0062\" num=\"0064\">Using the method described in WO 2010/046775, plasma cells can be cultured in limited numbers, or as single plasma cells in microwell culture plates. Antibodies can be isolated from the plasma cell cultures. Further, from the plasma cell cultures, RNA can be extracted and PCR can be performed using methods known in the art. The VH and VL gene regions of the antibodies can be amplified by RT-PCR, sequenced and cloned into an expression vector that is then transfected into HEK293T cells or other host cells. The cloning of nucleic acid in expression vectors, the transfection of host cells, the culture of the transfected host cells and the isolation of the produced antibody can be done using any methods known to one of skill in the art.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0063\" num=\"0065\">The antibodies may be further purified, if desired, using filtration, centrifugation and various chromatographic methods such as HPLC or affinity chromatography. Techniques for purification of antibodies, e.g., monoclonal antibodies, including techniques for producing pharmaceutical-grade antibodies, are well known in the art.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0064\" num=\"0066\">Fragments of the antibodies can be obtained from the antibodies by methods that include digestion with enzymes, such as pepsin or papain, and/or by cleavage of disulfide bonds by chemical reduction. Alternatively, fragments of the antibodies can be obtained by cloning and expression of part of the sequences of the heavy or light chains. Antibody &#x201c;fragments&#x201d; include Fab, Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)2 and Fv fragments. The invention also encompasses the use of single-chain Fv fragments (scFv) derived from the heavy and light chains of an antibody of the invention. For example, the invention includes the use of a scFv comprising the CDRs from a neutralizing antibody. Also included are the use of heavy or light chain monomers and dimers, single domain heavy chain antibodies, single domain light chain antibodies, as well as single chain antibodies, e.g., single chain Fv in which the heavy and light chain variable domains are joined by a peptide linker.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0065\" num=\"0067\">Antibody fragments may impart monovalent or multivalent interactions and be contained in a variety of structures as described above. For instance, scFv molecules may be synthesized to create a trivalent &#x201c;triabody&#x201d; or a tetravalent &#x201c;tetrabody.&#x201d; The scFv molecules may include a domain of the Fc region resulting in bivalent minibodies. Additional molecules for use in the invention include, but are not limited to, bispecific Fab2, trispecific Fab3, bispecific scFv, and diabodies.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0066\" num=\"0068\">Standard techniques of molecular biology may be used to prepare DNA sequences encoding the antibodies or antibody fragments. Desired DNA sequences may be synthesized completely or in part using oligonucleotide synthesis techniques. Site-directed mutagenesis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques may be used as appropriate.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0067\" num=\"0069\">Any suitable host cell/vector system may be used for expression of the DNA sequences encoding the antibody molecules of the present invention or fragments thereof. Bacterial, for example, <i>E. coli</i>, and other microbial systems may be used, in part, for expression of antibody fragments such as Fab and F(ab&#x2032;)2 fragments, and especially Fv fragments and single chain antibody fragments, for example, single chain Fvs. Eukaryotic, e.g., mammalian, host cell expression systems may be used for production of larger antibody molecules, including complete antibody molecules. Suitable mammalian host cells include, but are not limited to, CHO, HEK293T, PER.C6, NS0, myeloma or hybridoma cells.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0068\" num=\"0070\">Alternatively, antibodies for use in the invention may be produced by (i) expressing a nucleic acid sequence encoding an antibody of interest in a host cell, and (ii) isolating the expressed antibody product. Additionally, the method may include purifying the isolated antibody.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0069\" num=\"0071\">Transformed B cells and cultured plasma cells may be screened for those producing antibodies of the desired specificity or function. The screening step may be carried out by any immunoassay, e.g., ELISA, by staining of tissues or cells (including transfected cells), by neutralization assay or by one of a number of other methods known in the art for identifying desired specificity or function.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0070\" num=\"0072\">Individual transformed B cell clones may be produced from the positive transformed B cell culture. The cloning step for separating individual clones from the mixture of positive cells may be carried out using limiting dilution, micromanipulation, single cell deposition by cell sorting or other methods known in the art.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0071\" num=\"0073\">Nucleic acid from the cultured plasma cells can be isolated, cloned and expressed in HEK293T cells or other known host cells using methods known in the art.</p>\r",

      "<p id=\"p-0073\" num=\"0075\">The invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody and/or an antigen, as described above. The pharmaceutical composition may also contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient. Although the carrier or excipient may facilitate administration, it should not itself induce the production of antibodies harmful to the individual receiving the composition, nor should it be toxic. Suitable carriers may be large, slowly metabolized macromolecules such as proteins, polypeptides, liposomes, polysaccharides, polylactic acids, polyglycolic acids, polymeric amino acids, amino acid copolymers and inactive virus particles.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0074\" num=\"0076\">Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be used, for example mineral acid salts, such as hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, phosphates and sulphates, or salts of organic acids, such as acetates, propionates, malonates and benzoates.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0075\" num=\"0077\">Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers in therapeutic compositions may additionally contain liquids such as water, saline, glycerol and ethanol. Additionally, auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents or pH buffering substances, may be present in such compositions. Such carriers enable the pharmaceutical compositions to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries and suspensions, for ingestion by the subject.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0076\" num=\"0078\">Within the scope of the invention are compositions present in several forms of administration; the forms include, but are not limited to, those forms suitable for parenteral administration, e.g., by injection or infusion, for example by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Where the product is for injection or infusion, it may take the form of a suspension, solution or emulsion in an oily or aqueous vehicle and it may contain formulatory agents, such as suspending, preservative, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the antibody molecule may be in dry form, for reconstitution before use with an appropriate sterile liquid.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0077\" num=\"0079\">Once formulated, the compositions of the invention can be administered directly to the subject. In one embodiment the compositions are adapted for administration to mammalian, e.g., human subjects.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0078\" num=\"0080\">The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered by any number of routes including, but not limited to, oral, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-arterial, intramedullary, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intraventricular, transdermal, transcutaneous, topical, subcutaneous, intranasal, enteral, sublingual, intravaginal or rectal routes. Hyposprays may also be used to administer the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Typically, the therapeutic compositions may be prepared as injectables, either as liquid solutions or suspensions. Solid forms suitable for solution in, or suspension in, liquid vehicles prior to injection may also be prepared.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0079\" num=\"0081\">Direct delivery of the compositions will generally be accomplished by injection, subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intravenously or intramuscularly, or delivered to the interstitial space of a tissue. The compositions can also be administered into a lesion. Dosage treatment may be a single dose schedule or a multiple dose schedule. Known antibody-based pharmaceuticals provide guidance relating to frequency of administration e.g., whether a pharmaceutical should be delivered daily, weekly, monthly, etc. Frequency and dosage may also depend on the severity of symptoms.</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0080\" num=\"0082\">Compositions of the invention may be prepared in various forms. For example, the compositions may be prepared as injectables, either as liquid solutions or suspensions. Solid forms suitable for solution in, or suspension in, liquid vehicles prior to injection can also be prepared (e.g., a lyophilized composition, like Synagis&#x2122; and Herceptin&#x2122;, for reconstitution with sterile water containing a preservative). The composition may be prepared for topical administration e.g., as an ointment, cream or powder. The composition may be prepared for oral administration e.g., as a tablet or capsule, as a spray, or as a syrup (optionally flavoured). The composition may be prepared for pulmonary administration e.g., as an inhaler, using a fine powder or a spray. The composition may be prepared as a suppository or pessary. The composition may be prepared for nasal, aural or ocular administration e.g., as drops. The composition may be in kit form, designed such that a combined composition is reconstituted just prior to administration to a subject. For example, a lyophilized antibody can be provided in kit form with sterile water or a sterile buffer.</p>\r",

      "<p id=\"p-0095\" num=\"0097\">A neutralizing antibody (FI6) was administered intravenously to mice at different doses (0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg) 4 hours before intranasal infection with a sub-lethal dose of Influenza A H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus. Body weight loss and survival were followed for 14 days after infection (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>\r",

      "<p id=\"p-0096\" num=\"0098\">Mice receiving 10 mg/kg FI6 showed no body weight loss and no symptoms (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1D</figref>). Mice receiving 1 mg/kg FI6 showed only a very modest body weight loss without measurable symptoms (ruffled fur and/or respiratory distress) (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1C</figref>), while those receiving 0.1 mg/kg FI6 showed a substantial body weight loss, morbidity, and mortality comparable to the control group of mice receiving phosphate saline buffer only (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1A-B</figref>).</p>\r",
      "\r\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0097\" num=\"0099\">The immune response in these animals was assessed in serum 25 days after infection by measuring the presence of mouse IgG antibodies able to bind or neutralize the challenge virus (EC50 and IC50 values).
