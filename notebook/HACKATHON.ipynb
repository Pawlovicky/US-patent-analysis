Such bottles may be produced using a blow-and-blow manufacturing process or a press-and-blow manufacturing process, and typically have substantially uniform wall thicknesses. Moreover, longneck bottles are popular in the beverage packaging industry, particularly for packaging beer.

In one embodiment, the label <b>160</b> may be generally rectangular with transverse ends (not shown), and may be wrapped circumferentially around the body <b>124</b> such that the transverse ends overlap. In another embodiment, the label <b>160</b> may be circumferentially continuous and of generally hollow cylindrical shape, and the label <b>160</b> may be placed axially over the bottle <b>120</b> and shrink fit around the body <b>124</b>. The label <b>160</b> may be composed of any suitable material but, preferably, may be composed of paper, plastic film, or of any other suitable flaccid material.</p>',\n",

The axial ends <b>162</b><i>a,b </i>may be carried on the fourth surfaces <b>142</b><i>a,b</i>, for example, in circumferentially continuous surface contact therewith. In fact, the axial margins <b>164</b><i>a,b </i>may be adhered to the fourth surfaces <b>142</b><i>a,b </i>using pressure-sensitive adhesive carried by the label <b>160</b> or any other suitable adhesive, and the axial margins <b>164</b><i>a,b </i>may be sealed to the bottle <b>120</b> circumferentially continuously to provide an air-tight volume of air between the label <b>160</b> and the bottle <b>120</b>.</p>',\n",
       " '<p id=\"p-0034\" num=\"0033\">Also, or instead, the label <b>160</b> may be carried by at least some of the projections <b>152</b>. For example, corresponding portions of the label <b>160</b> may be adhered to the radially outwardly facing surfaces <b>154</b> of the projections using pressure-sensitive adhesive carried by the label <b>160</b> or any other suitable adhesive. The surface contact between the label <b>160</b> and the third surface <b>150</b> is characterized by multiple discrete contact areas such that there is no continuous path of surface contact between the label <b>160</b> and the third surface <b>150</b> for 360 angular degrees around the bottle.</p>',\n",

In other words, radial, axial, and circumferential space establishes one or more insulation volumes between the label <b>160</b> and the second surface <b>146</b> that extend continuously over more than 90 angular degrees around the container <b>120</b> about the axis A. The insulation volumes may include two insulation volumes that extend about 180 degrees around the container <b>120</b> about the axis A, except for the bridges <b>155</b>. Accordingly, one or more large volumes of air may be defined between the label <b>160</b> and the body <b>124</b> and may be circumferentially continuous for more than 90 degrees, axially between the shoulders <b>148</b><i>a,b</i>. In one embodiment, the two insulation volumes may be connected, for example, via reliefs <b>153</b> extending circumferentially across and radially into one or both of the bridges <b>155</b>, or in any other suitable manner. Accordingly, in contrast to prior approaches where a plurality of individual discrete pockets are established between a label and a bottle, here a much larger volume of air may be defined between the label <b>160</b> and the bottle <b>120</b> for improved insulative effect.</p>',\n",

In just one of many potential examples, the bottle <b>120</b> may be a longneck bottle having an overall height H, and the neck <b>128</b> (including neck finish <b>132</b>) having a neck height h. For purposes of the present disclosure, the term &#x201c;longneck bottle&#x201d; is defined as a bottle in which the height h of the bottle neck is at least 25% of the overall bottle height H. In illustrative embodiments of the present disclosure, the neck height h is in the range of 33% to 40% of bottle height H. The heights H, h may be measured to the sealing surface or lip <b>130</b> that axially terminates the neck <b>128</b> and neck finish <b>132</b>. Also, the bottle <b>120</b> may be a narrow neck bottle, having a thread diameter (so-called &#x201c;T&#x201d; dimension) or a crown diameter (so-called &#x201c;A&#x201d; dimension) not more than 38 mm. The bottle <b>120</b> is of one-piece integrally formed construction, for, example, of glass, ceramic, metal, or plastic construction. (The term &#x201c;integrally formed construction&#x201d; does not exclude one-piece integrally molded layered glass constructions of the type disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4,740,401, or one-piece glass or metal bottles to which other structure is added after the bottle-forming operation.) The bottle <b>120</b> may be composed of any suitable material, for example, glass, plastic, or metal. Glass bottles can be fabricated by press-and-blow and/or blow-and-blow manufacturing operations, or by any other suitable technique(s). Plastic bottles can be produced by injection and/or blow molding techniques. Metal bottles can be produced by bending, rolling, welding, or any other suitable forming or joining techniques.</p>',\n",

Moreover, longneck bottles are popular in the beverage packaging industry, particularly for packaging beer.

The transfer of the substrate is performed by, for example, a transfer robot disposed in a vacuum transfer chamber. In the aforementioned apparatus, there is required an ability to form a high-quality film at high throughput. For example, processing a substrate at a high temperature may be used as a method of providing a high-quality film. However, when repeatedly performing a process, the temperature of a substrate is accumulated in a transfer robot. Thus, deformation or the like of the components that constitute the transfer robot may occur. The deformation of the components may become a cause of frequent maintenance or the like. This poses a problem of reduction of throughput.</p>',\n",
